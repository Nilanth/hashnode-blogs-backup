## 10 UI Library to Make Your React App Development Faster

10 React UI libraries to make development faster and smoother.

React has a very large community, and it has n number of packages in all functionality. UI is the most valuable part of any Application. When it comes to React apps, we might have some complex UIs and flows.

We might require additional time to build a component from scratch. For example, If our component has a form or table, we might choose a third-party library to reduce the development time. But this will lead us to use many third-party packages in our app.

When our dependency increases, It will lead to some issues like some packages might get depreciated or not compactable with the new react version, so this will stop our app from upgrading to a newer version. This depends on the project.

To Reduce these kinds of issues and packages, We can choose a UI library. A UI library contains the most commonly used components and it has a larger community to keep it up to date. It is more than enough for most of the React App.

In this article, we can see the top 10 React UI libraries based on Github stars
